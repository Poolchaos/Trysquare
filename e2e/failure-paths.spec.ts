/**
 * The endings that are not success, walked through a browser.

 * the product's claim is that it survives them legibly. The integration layer
 * proves the state machine and the persistence. What only a browser can show
 * is that a person is told what happened and handed the way forward.
 *
 * Runs after the journey, which leaves a project and a ruleset behind, so
 * these can start a review without repeating the setup.
